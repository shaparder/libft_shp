# libft @ 42

This is the first 42 project. The task is to recreate partly the standard C
library functions, as well as extra functions which might be useful in the c coding world. The purpose of libft is to update and improve it with time on every new project.

## Compiling
You may compile `libft.a` by running `make`.

## Documentation
They should behave more or less the same as their standard C library
counterparts. However, I'll start documenting all of my libft for good
measure.

## Usage
Include it in your C project:
```c
#include "libft.h"
```

## Notice
Keep in mind that, altough being the first project of the school, the libft is constantly updated during the whole program by improving its use with every other project. Thereby, the libft actually in this repository is far from what it was at its very beginning. It wouldn't pass the norm and the rendu exigence because of it's complexification over time.
