# libft @ 42

This is the first 42 project. The task is to recreate partly the standard C
library functions, as well as extra functions which might be useful in the c coding world. The purpose of libft is to update and improve it with time on everybnew project.

## Compiling
You may compile `libft.a` by running `make`.

## Documentation
They should behave more or less the same as their standard C library
counterparts. However, I'll start documenting all of my libft for good
measure.

## Usage
Include it in your C project:
```c
#include "libft.h"
```
